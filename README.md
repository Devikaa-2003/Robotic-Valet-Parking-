# Robotic-Valet-Parking-
A scaled down robotic system designed to autonomously park and retrieve vehicles.  Focused on intelligent navigation and space optimization for smart mobility using ESP 32, RFID and IR sensors.
A compact, intelligent robotic system designed to automate the parking and retrieval of vehicles in a scaled-down model. Built as part of a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering project, this system aims to improve space utilization and reduce human effort in parking management.

Objectives:
- Automate vehicle parking and retrieval using robotic movement
- Identify and allocate empty slots using smart detection
- Implement RFID-based retrieval based on user input
- Enable safe and compact parking in constrained environments. 
                                     Key Features:
- Autonomous navigation within a predefined parking layout
- Real-time vehicle presence detection
- Unique identification of each parking slot
- Smooth parking and retrieval operations
- Scaled hardware prototype demonstrating concept feasibility
